##### Pre-Requisites: 

* The account running QueryTFS.exe must be a TFS/Azure DevOps Server Administrator.
* Supports only Azure DevOps Server, tested on TFS 2018


##### How-To: 

* Update the work-item query you want to run across all projects in the code, restore nuget packages, build and run in "Release" mode! 

##### Note:

* The code delimits ',' as default, if you have ',' in your work-item query result (example, title [as a customer, I ...] you'd have to modify the code accordingly
